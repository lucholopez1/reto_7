This update introduces the creation of a JSON menu system, allowing items to be added, updated, and deleted dynamically. The `create_menu` method now initializes an empty JSON file with proper formatting. The `add_menu_item` method was improved with error handling to prevent issues when reading a non-existent or empty file. Additionally, all JSON writing operations now include indentation for better readability. Finally, an example implementation at the end of the script demonstrates how to create a menu and add items.
